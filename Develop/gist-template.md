# Regex Tutorial

Reqex is a tool used by many developers around the world. It is very useful when incorporating aspects of user input in your websites that need to be in a correct format. By creating a regex expression, you can tell a user if their input is in the correct format that the host wants it to be in. An example of this would be a contact form for someone to reach back out to you, and they need your email address to contact you. If the input is accidently not an acceptable email address format the user should be issued a warning to fix their email.

## Summary

The regex expression that I will be describing to you today is the URL format. The format for a URL regex expression looks like this
 /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/
 I will explain to you what each of these symbols and letters mean in a regex expression, as well as how they fit for our example.
